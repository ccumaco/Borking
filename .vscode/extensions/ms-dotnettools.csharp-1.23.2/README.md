Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

-   Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
-   Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
-   Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has [limited support](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework).
-   Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

### Get Started Writing C# in VS Code

-   [Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp)
-   [Video Tutorial compiling with .NET Core](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-VSCode-Csharp-NET-Core-Windows)

## Note about using .NET Core 3.1.401 or .NET 5 Preview 8 SDKs on Mono platforms

Because of the new minimum MSBuild version requirement of these new SDKs, it will be necessary to use the Mono packaged with the C# extension. The meaning of "omnisharp.useGlobalMono" has change to "never", this forces the use of the included Mono. To use your system
install of Mono set the value to "always" although it may not be compatible with newer SDKs.

### Emmet support in Razor files

To enable emmet support, add the following to your settings.json:

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "aspnetcorerazor": "html"
}
```

### Semantic Highlighting

The C# semantic highlighting support is in preview. To enable, set `editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled` and `csharp.semanticHighlighting.enabled` to `true` in your settings. Semantic highlighting is only provided for code files that are part of the active project.

To really see the difference, try the new Visual Studio 2019 Light and Dark themes with semantic colors that closely match Visual Studio 2019.

### Supported Operating Systems for Debugging

-   Currently, the C# debugger officially supports the following operating systems:

    -   X64 operating systems:
        -   Windows 7 SP1 and newer
        -   macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and newer
        -   Linux: see [.NET Core documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2-supported-os.md#linux) for the list of supported distributions. Note that other Linux distributions will likely work as well as long as they include glibc and OpenSSL.
    -   ARM operating systems:
        -   Linux is supported as a remote debugging target
